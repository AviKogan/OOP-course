SpaceShip.java - implements the SpaceShip class, An abstract class that represents a non-type spaceShip.
SpaceShipFactory.java - implements the SpaceShipFactory class,  create all the spaceship objects according
                        to the command line arguments
Human.java - implements the Human class.
Runner.java - implements the Runner class.
Basher.java - implements the Basher class.
Aggressive.java - implements the Aggressive class.
Drunkard.java - implements the Drunkard class.
Special.java - implements the Special class, this ship has special fire that can fire a number of defined
shots, it's a combination of runner, aggressive and basher.

=============================

SpaceShip is an abstract class that has composition relation to SpaceShipPhysics class and SpaceWars class,
To SpaceShipPhysics - has data member "_spaceShipPhysics" that is instance of SpaceShipPhysics,
To SpaceWars - "ships" is a data member in SpaceWars class - that is array of instances of SpaceShip.

I implemented SpaceShip as abstract class because SpaceShip is not a concrete spaceship type, so there is no
reason to make instance of it, I chose not to implement it as interface, because not all the spaceships do the
same actions that already provided as part of the SpaceShip API, actions like transport, fire and shield.

Human extends SpaceShip class, implementation of Spaceship of type Human.
Runner extends SpaceShip class, implementation of Spaceship of type Runner.
Basher extends SpaceShip class, implementation of Spaceship of type Basher.
Aggressive extends SpaceShip class, implementation of Spaceship of type Aggressive.
Drunkard extends SpaceShip class, implementation of Spaceship of type Drunkard.
Special extends SpaceShip class, implementation of Spaceship of type Special.

=============================

In the abstract class SpaceShip I added 5 data members, all of them in private to control the changes done on
them.
I considered to use interfaces for each of the actions SpaceShip can do (fire, transport and shield),
but because there was methods signatures for each action in the SpaceShip provided API it became unnecessary.
I implemented the collidedWithAnotherShip method as abstract because ships that not use shield don't need to
check the field status, and I implemented two methods for collisions in SpaceShip, one for ships with shield
and one for shield-less ships, to avoid code duplication. The same I did with the gotHit method, This allows
flexibility that is reflected in the Special SpaceShip type, that it's gotHit and collidedWithAnotherShip
act differently.
I implemented the fire, teleport and shieldOn methods because they act the same for every inherited type that
do that action, if there need to be any change it can be override by the relevant type, like in the way the
Special ship fires. The implementation of the actions methods allow to inherited types that don't need some
action (for example Aggressive don't use teleport) to not implement them and just call the action they need,
so it give extensibility to add more actions in the same way.
All the methods and constants I added to the SpaceShip class that defined protected relevant for the inherited
ships type, and each one for number of types.

Drunkard - This ship can fire, activate it's shield and teleport, but it's doing all it's actions randomly and
           independently to the other action.
Special - This spaceship attempts to run away from the closest ship. It will always accelerate, and will
          constantly turn away from the closest ship similar to the Runner.
          Similar to the Aggressive - If its angle to the nearest ship is less than 0.21 radians, it will try
          to fire to defense itself, instead of regular fire it has the specialFire.
          Similar to the Basher if it gets within a distance of 0.19 units (inclusive) from another ship,
          it will attempt to turn on its shields.
          Not like all the other ships the special ships can't defend against shots, so each shot reduce its
          life.
