Book.java - implements the Book class.
Patron.java - implements the Patron class.
Library.jave - contains the Library implementation, using the implementations of Book and Library.

=============================
According to the given API:
the Patron class extends the Book class.
the Library class extends the Patron Class,

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I implemented with the Library class two array, one holds the registered patrons (instances of Patron) and one
the books (instances of Book) added to the library.
I chose this design because it allows naturally to give each book or patron his index in the array as his ID,
and also manage the patrons/books in easy eay. Each new book/patron assigned to the first available index in
his array, so to make the searching in both arrays efficient i used two static private variables
(currentBookCapacity, currentPatronsCapacity)  that represents the current capacity in each array and
therefore also each one represent the first available index in the array, by using both variables there is no
need to search in the all array every time search is needed, and each gives the index for new patron/book if
needed.
